You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104

Answer


class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int i=0;
        int j=height.length-1;
        int minHeight = 0;
        int currArea = 0;
        int n=0,m=0;
        int maxArea = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        while(i<j){
            m = i;
            n = j;
            if(height[i]<height[j]){
                minHeight=height[i++];
            }
            else{
                if(height[i] == height[j])
                    i++;
                minHeight=height[j--];
            }
            currArea = minHeight*(n-m);
            if(maxArea < currArea){
                maxArea = currArea;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
