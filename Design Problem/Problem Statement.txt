Problem Statement:
Consider you have a folder A which contains files of different formats (.csv, pdf, etc). You need to write two main components, let's say component A and component B. Below are the details of operations performed by these components
Component A:
Keep polling Folder A
Build XML using this CSV (It could be pdf as well)
Send XML to 2nd Component
Getting Response back in XML
Storing that Response in some Folder
Extra BONUS: Convert response XML to CV and then store it in folder
Move processed file to another file

Component B:
It will accept XMI
It will translate this XML to some Java Object
Some processing on top of it
Create Response XML by using processed data send back the response

For Example:
Folder A contains one csv file containing students data. You need to poll that folder and get that csy file in the component A.
Convert that cv to xml mappings
and send it to component B for processing. Then component B will process that cay again send processed xl back to the first component. Then the first component will directly save that file to a specific output folder or convert it back to esy and then store it in the output folder. Since this file is processed we should not see that file in the input folder. If the file format is not supported, move that file to the discarded folder.
